# Student Course Management System 

Student Course Management System is a Java-based console application that allows students to register, log in, and enroll in courses, while admins can manage courses and view registered students. It demonstrates core Java concepts like object-oriented programming, file handling, and user input validation. The application uses .txt files for data storage and features a modular structure with clear separation of models, services, and utilities.
